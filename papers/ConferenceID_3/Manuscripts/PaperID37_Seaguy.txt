Straight from the brow of one of comics' unique creators — Grant Morrison — comes SEAGUY, a hero without purpose in a world without evil! Featuring breathtaking art from Cameron Stewart, SEAGUY collects the 3-issue Vertigo miniseries that follows the strange adventure of would-be hero Seaguy and his faithful companion Chubby Da Choona as they try and decipher the mystery of Xoo — a ubiquitous new food that seems to have evolved into a brand-new conscious lifeform! Quirky and heart-wrenching at the same time, SEAGUY is that rarest of creations: something utterly and completely new. “Aye, aye, Seaguy!”
