A woman whose face is horribly scarred finds herself in an institution for "defective" government agents. She (Kabuki) is interrogated to find out if she is hiding something to do with the nature of her scars, or if she is simply crazy. Isolated and psychologically tormented, her only comfort is found in a mystery friend who sends handwritten messages that are folded into origami animals. Or is it just another trick? This Collection: Now back in print! Collecting the entire Skin Deep series (and the Kabuki Fan Edition) in a brand new and improved prestige edition with extra pages!
