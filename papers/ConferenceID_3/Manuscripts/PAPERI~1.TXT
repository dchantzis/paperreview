Cooke's affectionate reinterpretation of DC's early-1960s superheroes gets the Absolute treatment, slipcase and all. The large scale shows off Cooke's dynamic, neotraditionalist artwork to spectacular advantage, particularly the "widescreen" horizontal panels that echo the era's prevailing cinematic format, and it emphasizes the ambitious tale's epic sweep. The deluxe edition includes news-story pages, annotations, rare promotional art, and other extras. New Frontier might not have the high profile of other Absolute Edition selections, such as Neil Gaiman's Sandman and Frank Miller's Dark Knight, but it, too, deserves the elaborate presentation.
