Maya Lopez — a.k.a. Echo — a deaf young woman capable of assimilating an individual’s fighting style by sight and who nearly took down Daredevil — makes her return. Her entire life was once defined by her belief that Daredevil killed her father and that the Kingpin could help her achieve justice. Now, with her perceptions completely altered, can she make sense of the world? Echo embarks on a Native American vision quest to pick up the pieces of her shattered life.
