Welcome to the Unmanned world. In the summer of 2002, a plague of unknown origin destroyed every last sperm, fetus, and fully developed mammal with a Y chromosome—with the apparent exception of one young man and his male pet. This "gendercide" instantaneously exterminated 48% of the global population, or approximately 2.9 billion men. Now, aided by the mysterious Agent 355, the last human male Yorick Brown must contend with dangerous extremists, a hoped-for reunion with a girlfriend on the other side of the globe, and the search for exactly why's he's the only man to survive. Collecting the first story arc of Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra's masterly new Vertigo series, Y: The Last Man—Unmanned brings to vivid life the age-old speculation: What would really happen to the last man on Earth?
