A CHRISTMAS EVE HEIST STORY - JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. Tracy Lawless has come home for his first Christmas in the city in nearly twenty years. But the only kind of family reunion he'll find is in a graveyard, because his last living relative, his little brother Ricky, was killed almost a year earlier. Now Tracy is back to find out who did it, and why, and to do that he'll have to immerse himself back into the criminal world that he once ran away from. The question is, even if he finds the answers he seeks, will he survive the experience? Winner of the EISNER AWARDS for Best Writer and Best New Series!
