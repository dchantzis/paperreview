In a remote coastal village in Northern Scotland, the choice between money and happiness has never been clearer or carried such deadly consequences. When Moss arrives, he is accepted as what he appears to be: a somewhat grubby American backpacker on holiday. Gradually the town begins to realize just who it is they're harboring: a Special Forces soldier turned drugs smuggler. If that wasn't bad enough, he has a lot of really rough bastards riding into town after him. The safety of the town and the woman he loves vs. the successful conclusion of a very lucrative drug deal... which will Moss choose?
