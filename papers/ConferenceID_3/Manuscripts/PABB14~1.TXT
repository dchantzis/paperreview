This out-of-continuity story features reporter Ben Urich, and has not been collected in the hardcovers. This may be because the first HC volume was all JoeQuesada, and the second and third all Alex Maleev art; perhaps this David Mack storyline is being held back for a future HC volume including his upcoming second run on Daredevil. From Marvel Comics: A moody, heartfelt tale of heroism and family tragedy by Brian Michael Bendis, the red-hot writer of Ultimate Spider-Man and Alias—with fully painted covers and interior art by David Mack (Kabuki)! Meet Ben Urich, investigative reporter for the Daily Bugle. His current assignment: the media circus that is the murder trial of Wilson Fisk, the so-called Kingpin of Crime! At least, that's the gospel according to his editor, J. Jonah Jameson. So why is Urich spending all his time with the catatonic son of the two-bit costumed criminal called Leap Frog? And how is Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, connected to a child he doesn't even know? His objectivity shattered, Urich finds himself doubting his journalistic integrity and the future of his very profession! In their first full-length collaboration, acclaimed auteus Bendis and Mack deliver a superhero story unlike any other!
